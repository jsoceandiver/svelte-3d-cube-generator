This project is an experiment with **Svelte JS** and **3D CSS**. It's a small generator tool that creates a 3D cube / prism according to the user input. It's possible to select rotation type, easing, prism dimensions, background colors, and other properties. Once the user selects all the values, it's possible to copy generated HTML / CSS or download the working HTML page. The tool keeps chosen values in the local storage.

Feel free to play with it and share your feedback.
